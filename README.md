MARKET DYNAMICS:
The micromobilty market has shown tremendous growth in the past years all around the world. Investors have poured more than $9 billion into micro-mobility companies worldwide this year. In Indian too micro-mobility is a fast-growing market and an  underpenetrated market. With an increase in traffic and congestion, citizens have switched to public transport like buses, local trains, and metro to reach their destinations. Everyday an estimated 25 million people travel via Delhi Metro, an estimated 7.5 million people take the Mumbai local trains, and about 4.5 million people take the non-AC bus service in Bengaluru. However, traveling very short distances to get from the nearest transportation hub to your workplace or home is still a huge problem.The market is predicted to grow rate has been predicted to be 20.2%. 
Competition in the micromobility market has also improved over the past years.Major companies in the market include mybyk,vogo,zypp and bouncen. Not only these companies have received huge fundings, they somehow have the lion share in the market. Last year, the scooter rental market saw a funding explosion with two large players emerging — Vogo ($108 million), and Bounce ($24 million), backed by Accel and Sequoia Capital. Whereas yulu secured a total funding of 7 mn till 2019.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
After analysing the user personas an having done the guesstimate our major target would be to expand our services in smart-cities and metro cities since the use of mobility services is significantly done by the work commute. Our future aim would be is to make available our serives to working prorfessionsl and college students who travel to reach theirs workplaces or college and face the issue of first and last mile transport.

B2B Marketing:
In this strategy, we would be targeting the working class mainly. So we have our rides available at most of the public transportation stations but it would be quite inevitable for our customers to use our product if we don’t provide them with a YULU zone at their final destination. So we have planned to install yulu zones in the company campuses to make yulu more convenient for the work commute. What the company would benefit from this is that we would pay the company considerable parking charges for every vehicle we place on their campus. We make the company motivate their employees to use our services, since if the usage increases it would benefit both the parties. We are planning to discuss our presentation with the HR head of the company if that’s possible because our services mainly concerns the employees.
